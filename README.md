# [LIGNUM] ðŸªµ

#### âŸ¿ A simple [boids algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) implementation

## Origin

Looked cool, so I wanted to do it myself, at first I wanted to do it in OpenGL,

but then it meant that I should learn every concept in graphics programming and I have no such time (for now)

Thus I made it with a rust game engine.

It works great (though it's highly unoptimize ðŸ¤«), but as I took some freedom in the process, I _~kind of~_ deviated from

boids original algorithm, as a consequence it's more a fluid simulation game (with bird?) than bird flying in a flock

but who care, I had fun and I could watch all day these birds simulating a fluid.

## Purpose

1. Have fun
2. To understand some gamedev concept
3. Improving my rust skills

## Made with:

1. **Elegance** âœ…
2. `RUST` âœ¨ðŸ¦€
3. [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez): _game engine_
